# Hashes and the Internet

### Define

- GET requests
- Server responses
- Developer console
- APIs
- JSON (string formatted as a hash/object)

# JavaScript Object Notation
- poorly named? doesn't care about JS
- language-agnostic
  - in ruby this could be translated to a hash
- a way for applications to share data and make it accesible to third parties

# API
- application programming interface
- api is the way we interact with something
- a way for us to read information and change information

# SRP
- methods should do one thing and do it well
- smaller methods are easier to reuse 'modular code'

### Deliverables

- Write an application that takes a search term from a user
- Make a Request to the GoogleBooks API and get back some results
- https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=ruby+programming
- Display the titles, author names, and description for each book
